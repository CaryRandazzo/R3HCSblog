title: "Why I Rebuilt a Real-Time Heat Simulation System"

Good day,

I'd like to share with you why I rebuilt a real-time heat simulation system.

As my Masters is in Applied Physics and PhD is in Computational Analysis and Modeling, physical simulations were constantly a subject of my study even if it wasn't my initial focus. Some time while pursuing those degrees, I landed a role that was specifically interested in the simulation of Welding as realistically as possible - this was my prior role. 

Naturally, a logical starting point for such a goal would be to simulate Heat Conduction. It requires a significant amount of expertise in multiple areas to pull this off including Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics so it is not something your average developer is expected to know how to do in a real-time 3D environment. 

I had done everything from design, to developing the rendering pipeline, and optimized perofrmance with algorithms and Unreal Engine based Compute Shaders culminating in a business owned heat conduction plugin. 

After leading development on this simulation system in that prior role, I decided to build an original version with my own know how, on my own equipment, and on my own personal time to push my skills further as well as the performance of the system while experimenting with a variety of different approaches and exploring research in the field.


What will happen next on the project, you say?

This clean take on Real-Time 3D Heat Conduction will utilize and acknowledge publically available information frequently as the field if heat conduction simulation has a long history and is rich in information. So, my next post will focus on initial designs, expected features, requirements of R3HCS, etc. from conception to deployment. 

It is likely that some of this will change and be modified as the project continues forward, but this initial map of the problem will keep us grounded toward the goal of R3HCS which is of course, Real-Time 3D Heat Conduction in Unreal Engine.

I do not intend to post complete source code, but there will be plenty of details explaining what I am doing, in most cases how to do it, and snippets of code that provide problem and/or solution examples for those interested in learning or trying it for themselves.

It's going to be complex and exciting, if you can learn something interesting along the way, feel free to follow along.

See you in the next post,
- Cary
